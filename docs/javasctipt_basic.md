# Javascript Foundmentals 

As a lightweight programming language towards interactions in web browser initially, Javascript has been grown into a cross-platform language that could be use to develop not only web applications but also the mobile and the desktop applications(event for `Game Weaver`, developed with Javascript). Javascript has won [the great popularity](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/13/developer-survey-results-are-in/) during recent 10 years and continued to evolve through each ECMAScript standard revision and release. Javascript is straight forward and easy to understand, most importantly it's a beginner friendly language I often recommand to zero-knowlege beginners to give it a try. It's also the my favorite launguage that i have been working on for more than 10 years.

Hi Dear Game Weavers:

Welcome to the Coding Challenge `Whac-A-Mole` part-3: Calculate Position.

In this challenge, you willl draw a 4x4 mole grid with mole-drawing function, specifically, learn how to layout moles with a starting point and mole size.

Lets first uncomment line 11 in our starting code by clicking the line 11 and pressing key combination `Ctrl + /` in windows or `CMD + /`.

Once the double slash characters at the start of line 11 is disappeared, we could then press the `Run` button beside the coding area.

What would happen? A cute mole out of its burrow on a beautiful grassland! right?

This is the first step of our challenge 3.

Next, lets move our mouse cursor to the line 11, to see what would happen?

There would be small pane that describe the current `drawMoleHoleWithDynaHead`:

- the 1st parameter is `posX`, a number, it defines the mole start point horizontal coordinate.
- the 2nd parameter is `posY`, a number, it defines mole start point vertical coordinate.
- the 3rd parameter is `position?`, a number, `?` means its an optional parameter that can define the mole body height above its burrow.

The pane is an complete instruction about the usage of this `drawMoleHoleWithDynaHead` function, which includes decription, params explanations, lastly the `return` type. In this function, it returns nothing to user, that is what `void` means.

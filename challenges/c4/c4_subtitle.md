Hi Dear Game Weavers:

Welcome to the Coding Challenge `Whac-A-Mole` part-4: Make it moving.

In this challenge, we will create randomly appearing moles with a simple approach: 

> Generate a random position with javascript random function Math.random()

By applying this approach, we pick a random postion of mole grid to draw the mole with an appropriate mole size at the painting function.

The painting function is called `paintOnEachSecond`, like it's name, this function will be executed on each second.

So, we just change the outstanding mole position, draw it, then with the time changes, the game start running like a charm!


### First step: Generate a random value within two boundary values


....



### Second step: Format a float value into an integer value


...


### Third step: Declare a size value with a ternary expression

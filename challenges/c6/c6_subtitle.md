Hi Dear Game Weavers:

Welcome to Coding Challenge `Whac-A-Mole` part-6: Hit Testing.

In this challenge, we are going to learn how to detect if a mole is being hit!

That is to say, how do we know our hammer has hit the mole above its burrow?

We will use mathematical formula to help us describe the relationship of two game objects, in our game, they are `hammer` and `mole`!

By understanding the basic theory of `Collision Detection`, we could check the relationship of two game object, 

and setup a `threshold`, then, we could decide if two objects are successfully colliding.

Not very clear? 

That's all right! let's move on!


## First step: figure out task

Lets first click the `Run` button, try to see what would happen?

The game is running, but we got one test failure in message panel, it saying: 

> âœ˜ ðŸ¤” test `checkCollision` implementation under threshold case!

That is expected, because we havent finished the coding tasks in this challenge!

Let's take a look at the coding editor, to find out what's the tasks...

In the code line `18`, we could see a `NOTE` mark, that reveals us the description of function `checkCollision`.

The function is designed to implement a very simple two-objects collision testing method, just like the description of the function said, we just need checking the straight distance of two objects, if it's below the threshold value, we could think of collision success, otherwise not!

You may wonder, how to know the distance of two objects which are mole and hammer? 

No worries, let's proceed to the function body to discover more details!

## Second step: find the solution

By checking code of `checkCollision` function, we can see two constant declaration `xDiff` and `yDiff`.

What does it mean?

Actually, `xDiff` means the horizontal distance of two objects, `yDiff` means the vertical distance of two objects.

So, since we got the got the horizontal and the vertical distance of two objects, how do we know the straight distance?

This is the key point of this challenge!

In a 2D space or 2D coordinate system, there is only one way to calculate the distance of two points:

> Pythagorean theorem

Just like belowing illustration, we want to get the distance `c` of two red points: 

- point-1, being represented by a 2D coordinate (x1, y1), 
- point-2, being represented by a 2D coordinate (x2, y2),

To get the distance of point 1 and point 2 which is called length of `hypotenuse` , we could utilize the `Pythagorean theorem` to calculate the `hypotenuse` by two adjacent sides.

![stackoverflow_pythagoras_theorem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwz7512/game-weaver-ast/master/images/stackoverflow_pythagoras_theorem.png)

A simple pseudo-code to implement the `pythagorean theorem` in javascript may like this:

```
var a = x1 - x2;
var b = y1 - y2;
// c is the distance, 
// The Math.sqrt() static method returns the square root of a number.
var c = Math.sqrt( a*a + b*b );
```

Ok, we enough basic math knowledge and some javascript psedu code to apply in our collision test algorithm!

Let's find out the similarities between the function `checkCollision` and psedu-code above!

Now that we got the equation of hypotenuse, lets find out what's the side `a` in the `checkCollision` function?

Is it possilbe `xDiff`? Yes! absolutely! Side `a` is just the horizontal distance of two points.

In the same way, we conclude that `yDiff` is just the side `b`, the vertical distance of two points.

oh yeah, it seems our answer is just ahead! right?


## Third step: write the expression

Let's try to write the equation for the constant `distance` in code line `30`:

First, we copy the hypotenuse formula:

```
Math.sqrt( a*a + b*b )
```

Then, use it to replace the harde coded value `100` in the code line `30`;

Last, we replace `xDiff` to replace `a`, and use `yDiff` to replace `b`;

Now, we got this expression:

```
const distance = Math.sqrt( xDiff*xDiff + yDiff*yDiff );
```

Oh, yeah! this is our solution to get the straight disatance of hammer and mole!


Let's hit the `Run` button to see if it works?

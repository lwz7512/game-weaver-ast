Hi Dear Game Weavers:

Welcome to Coding Challenge `Whac-A-Mole` part-6: Hit Testing.

In this challenge, we are going to learn how to detect if a mole is being hit!

That is to say, how do we know our hammer has hit the mole above its burrow?

We will use mathematical formula to help us describe the relationship of two game objects, in our game, they are `hammer` and `mole`!

By understanding the basic theory of `Collision Detection`, we could check the relationship of two game object, 

and setup a `threshold`, then, we could decide if two objects are successfully colliding.

Not very clear? 

That's all right! let's move on!


## First step: 

Lets first click the `Run` button, to see what would happen?


## Second step:

Checking code of `checkCollistion` function, 


## Third step:

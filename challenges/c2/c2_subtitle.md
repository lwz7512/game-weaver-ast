Hi Dear Game Weavers:

Welcome to Coding Challenge `Whac-A-Mole` part-2: Loop statement.

In this challenge, you will learn how to use javascript `for` loop statement to do repetitive jobs.

So, What is loop statement?

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

Computers can do two things best than human beings could:

1. Computation
2. Repeat a same job such as computation


We human beings surely could do some repetitive jobs, such as carving a shape from a piece of wood, but without the computer's help,

we couldn't produce thounsands of hundreds of sculptures with the exact same size, stroke and depth.

To instruct the computer do the repetitive work in Javascript programming language, we use `for` loop statement.

`for` means you are telling computer to do a job under some condtion.

Lets take a look at FIRST part of the format of `for` loop statement:

```
for ( looping scope or condition )
```

The `looping scrope or condition` included by a pair of parentheses mentioned above could be expressed as a format like this:

```
let x = 0; x < 6; x++
```

There are 3 parts here separated by semicolon:

First part is `let x = 0`, it means we defined a variable(`let`) named `x` initialized a value of `0`.

Second part is `x < 6`, it limits the loopping end to less than 6.

Third part is `x++`, it changes counter `x` value by one each time after one loop done.

Then, lets take a look at the SECOND part of `for` loop statement after parentheses:

```
{
  looping job
}
```
